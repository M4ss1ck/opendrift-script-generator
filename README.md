# OpenDrift script creator

This is a Node.js application that generates Python scripts for OpenDrift simulations based on command line parameters.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To use this application, run the following command:

```
npm run start -- --param1=value1 --param2=value2
```

Replace `param1` and `param2` with the names of the parameters you want to pass to the Python script, and `value1` and `value2` with the corresponding values.

The application will generate a Python script based on these parameters and save it in the `src/pythonScripts` directory.
